# RGB and CMYK Color Mixer

## Overview

This project implements a color mixer for RGB and CMYK color spaces. It allows users to visualize the blending of colors by manipulating the red, green, blue (RGB) components or the cyan, magenta, yellow, key (CMYK) components. The application displays a grid of 10x10 squares representing pixels, with the resulting color displayed in the output square.
